# Overview
This project focuses on data mining and business intelligence (BI) for a bike sales data warehouse. It includes scripts to extract data from a SQLite database (`bike_dw.db`), generate data profiling reports using `ydata-profiling`, and visualize these reports through a Flask web application. Additionally, the project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict sales quantities using a PyTorch neural network, with a web interface for inference.

The reports provide insights into the data warehouse tables, such as customer, date, product, staff, store, and sales data. The machine learning component allows users to predict sales quantities based on input features like year, month, product, store, and more.

# Features
- **Data Profiling**: Generate detailed HTML reports for each table in the data warehouse using `ydata-profiling`.
- **Web Visualization**: A Flask-based web application to view the generated reports interactively.
- **Sales Prediction**: Train a neural network model using PyTorch to predict sales quantities, with a web interface for inference.
- **Data Source**: SQLite database (`bike_dw.db`) containing the bike sales data warehouse.


# Required Python Packages
Install the required packages via `pip`:

pip install flask pandas ydata-profiling torch sklearn numpy joblib

# Setup and Usage
## Step 1: Generate Data Profiling Reports

Run the bi.py script to generate HTML reports for each table in the data warehouse. This script connects to the bike_dw.db database, extracts data from each table, and uses ydata-profiling to create profiling reports.

python bi.py

After running the script, HTML reports will be generated in the reports/ folder, such as:

Dim_Customer_report.html

Dim_Date_report.html

Dim_Product_report.html

Dim_Staff_report.html

Dim_Store_report.html

Fact_Sales_report.html

## Step 2: Train the Sales Prediction Model
Run the train.py script to train a neural network model using PyTorch. This script extracts data from bike_dw.db, trains the model on sales data, and saves the trained model and scaler to the checkpoint/ folder.

python train.py

After running, the following files will be generated:

checkpoint/sales_predictor.pth: The trained PyTorch model.

checkpoint/scaler.pkl: The scaler used for data preprocessing.

## Step 3: Run the Flask Web Application
Run the app.py script to start the Flask web server, which allows you to visualize the reports and perform sales predictions through a web interface.

python app.py

The Flask app will start on http://localhost:8080. Open this URL in your browser to access the web interface.

## Step 4: Visualize Reports and Predict Sales

View Reports: The main page (index.html) displays a list of all available reports. Click on a report link to view its detailed data profiling, including statistics, correlations, and visualizations generated by ydata-profiling.

Predict Sales: Below the report list, there is a form where you can input values (e.g., year, month, product key, etc.) to predict sales quantities using the trained model. Submit the form to see the predicted sales quantity.
