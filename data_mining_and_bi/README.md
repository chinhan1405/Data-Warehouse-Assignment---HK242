# Overview
This project focuses on data mining and business intelligence (BI) for a bike sales data warehouse. It includes scripts to extract data from a SQLite database (bike_dw.db), generate data profiling reports using ydata-profiling, and visualize these reports through a Flask web application. The reports provide insights into the data warehouse tables, such as customer, date, product, staff, store, and sales data.

# Features
Data Profiling: Generate detailed HTML reports for each table in the data warehouse using ydata-profiling.
Web Visualization: A Flask-based web application to view the generated reports interactively.
Data Source: SQLite database (bike_dw.db) containing the bike sales data warehouse.

# Required Python packages (install via pip):

** pip install flask pandas ydata-profiling **
Additionally, ensure the SQLite database (bike_dw.db) is located in the ../data_warehouse/ directory relative to the project folder.

# Setup and Usage

## Step1: Run the bi.py script to generate HTML reports for each table in the data warehouse. This script connects to the bike_dw.db database, extracts data from each table, and uses ydata-profiling to create profiling reports.

** python bi.py **

After running the script, HTML reports will be generated in the reports/ folder, such as:
-Dim_Customer_report.html
-Dim_Date_report.html
-Dim_Product_report.html
-Dim_Staff_report.html
-Dim_Store_report.html
-Fact_Sales_report.html

## Step 2: Run the Flask Web Application
Run the app.py script to start the Flask web server, which allows you to visualize the reports in your browser.

** python app.py **

The Flask app will start on http://localhost:8080. Open this URL in your browser to access the web interface.

## Step 3: Visualize Reports
The main page (index.html) will display a dropdown menu listing all available reports.
Select a report from the dropdown to view its detailed data profiling, including statistics, correlations, and visualizations generated by ydata-profiling.
